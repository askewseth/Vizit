### Vizit

Just a demo of Plot.ly with Flask and python to allow users to visualize arbitraty data and store their plots.

### Dependencies

- flask
- bokeh
- matplotlib
- numpy
- itsdangerous
- sqlalchemy
- bokeh
- pandas

The deps can be installed by using `pip`. If any of them fail please raise and [issue](https://github.com/sible777/Vizit/issues).

### What's Working
- generating data plots is mostly functional, multiplots still do not work.
- logins work.
- generating statistical data on data sets works.
- API endpoint returns and accepts data properly.

### What we still need to add
- More data sanitization/validation.
- Better styling/ui design
- account management
- More plot types
- File uploads
